    Vives is one of the most emblematic artists of Colombia and one of the most

    <p class="second">Carlos Vives, the man who modernized one of the best artistic expressions
      in Colombia, was predestined to creation and, especially, to music. And,
      through his art, and perhaps unknowingly, also predestined to become the
      representative of that pure and honest Colombian, who with each act praises
      his country.
      Vives always had the artistic virus to the surface. In 1982, with a little
      more than 20 years, he began his career as an actor in the children's television
      program Pequeños gigantes. In the three long years that he was on the screen
      he showed that, although small, he left giant footprints in his path. In
      1984 he graduated as a publicist from the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University,
      with a postgraduate degree in television production. He starred, along with
      great actors, various series and soap operas including El Pharaoh and Tuyo
      is my heart, being remembered for embodying famous characters like "Gallito"
      Ramírez and the famous composer Rafael Escalona.
      This samara captivated crowds in America and Europe with the rhythms of
      Classics of La Provincia, album with which he broke his own sales record
      (Triple Gold Record and Triple Platinum Record in 1993 and 1995),
      which boasted the soundtrack of Escalona. In the same way, he managed to
      locate in the first places of the pop listings songs of juglares vallenatos
      like Emiliano Zuleta, Juancho Polo Valencia, Luis Enrique Martinez and
      Carlos Huertas, among others.</p>

            Latin Songs, with hits like: When we meet again Marc Anthony, Dance with you,
            The sea of your eyes and I was reborn, which became a hymn in Latin America,
            dominating radios in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru,
            Central America and Colombia. The Más corazón profunda tour became the most
            successful tour in the history of Colombia, with more than 200,000 fans filling
